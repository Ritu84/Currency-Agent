# uAgent Projects - SMS Notifications and Two-Agent Communication 🚀🤖
This repository showcases two distinct projects that utilize the uAgents framework to demonstrate different functionalities. Each project serves a specific purpose, highlighting the versatility of uAgents for various applications.

### Project 1: Currency Monitoring Agent, Notification via SMS🌐💱
The Currency Monitoring Agent continuously tracks currency exchange rates and sends text messages based on user-defined thresholds. This project demonstrates how to monitor currency rates and notify users when rates fall below or rise above specified limits.

#### Features:

- **Real-time currency exchange rate monitoring.**
- **Notification system for user-defined currency rate thresholds.**
- **Environment variable setup for API keys.**
- **For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the Currency Monitoring Agent README.**

### Project 2: Currency Monitoring Agent (Notifying by remote communication between two agents) 🌡️🤖
The Currency Monitoring Agent, affectionately known as "currency_agent," monitors currency of  selected countries with respect to a base currency, if the value of the observed currencies either falls below the minimum value provided by the user or rises above the maximum value given by the user, another uagent bob gets notifies by a remote communication channel.

#### Features:

- **Temperature monitoring in a user-specified location.**
- **Remote communication between agents.**
- **Configurable temperature thresholds.**
- **For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the Temperature Monitoring Agent (Bob) README.**
  
Explore these projects to see how uAgents can be applied to various use cases. Whether you're interested in currency monitoring and notifications or agent-to-agent communication, these projects offer valuable insights into leveraging uAgents for your applications.

Happy coding and experimenting with uAgents! 🚀🤖
