# uAgent Projects - Currency Agent 🚀🤖

The basic idea of this currency agent is that, the user will enter a base currency, and the other currencies which he/she need to monitor. He/She will enter his/her minimum and maximum desired values of the currencies they need to observe with respect to the base currency, If at any time, the value of any of the observed currency either falls below the desired minimum value, or rises above the desired maximum value, the user gets notified, here i have implemented 2 approaches that stuck in my mind, in the first one, the user gets notified via an sms, and in the other one, the another uagents gets notified in an established remote connection server.

### Project 1: Currency Monitoring Agent, Notification via SMS🌐💱
The Currency Monitoring Agent continuously tracks currency exchange rates and sends text messages based on user-defined thresholds. This project demonstrates how to monitor currency rates and notify users when rates fall below or rise above specified limits.

#### Features:

- **Real-time currency exchange rate monitoring.**
- **Notification system for user-defined currency rate thresholds.**
- **Environment variable setup for API keys.**
- **For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the Currency Monitoring Agent README.**

### Project 2: Currency Monitoring Agent (Notifying by remote communication between two agents) 🌡️🤖
The Currency Monitoring Agent, affectionately known as "currency_agent," monitors currency of  selected countries with respect to a base currency, if the value of the observed currencies either falls below the minimum value provided by the user or rises above the maximum value given by the user, another uagent bob gets notifies by a remote communication channel.

#### Features:

- **Currency monitoring in a user-specified base currency.**
- **Remote communication between agents.**
- **Configurable currency thresholds.**
- **For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the Currency Monitoring Agent README.**
  
Explore these projects to see how uAgents can be applied to various use cases. Whether you're interested in currency monitoring and notifications or agent-to-agent communication, these projects offer valuable insights into leveraging uAgents for your applications.

Happy coding and keep experimenting with uAgents! 🚀🤖
